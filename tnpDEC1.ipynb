    "> Pillars of Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Input refers to the data, dataset, or problem set that the algorithm processes to produce an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-life example:** Consider a weather forecasting algorithm. The input would include data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure collected from various sensors and weather stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Output is the result or response generated by the algorithm after processing the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-life example:** In the context of the weather forecasting algorithm, the output could be a prediction of the weather conditions for the next 24 hours, including details like expected temperature, precipitation, and wind direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finiteness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Finiteness ensures that the algorithm has a fixed number of steps and takes a predictable amount of time to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-life example:** Consider a navigation algorithm in a GPS application. It needs to calculate the optimal route from the current location to a destination, and the number of steps to determine this route should be finite and well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definiteness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Definiteness ensures that each step of the algorithm is precisely and unambiguously defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-life example:** Think about a sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort. In each step, it clearly defines the comparison and swapping of elements based on a specified condition until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effectiveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Effectiveness ensures that each step of the algorithm contributes to solving the problem or achieving the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-life example:** Imagine an image recognition algorithm used in facial recognition technology. Each step in the algorithm, such as feature extraction and pattern recognition, contributes to the effectiveness of identifying and matching faces accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pillars collectively define the characteristics of a well-designed algorithm, ensuring that it takes specific inputs, processes them in a finite and definite manner, and produces effective and meaningful outputs."

    "- **Definition:** Priori analysis involves predicting the performance of an algorithm before it is actually executed. It is based on theoretical analysis and mathematical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps in selecting the most efficient algorithm for a specific problem without the need for actual implementation and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** Before implementing a sorting algorithm for a large dataset, you might analyze the time complexity based on the algorithm's design to estimate how it will perform concerning input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Posteriori:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Posteriori analysis involves evaluating the performance of an algorithm after it has been executed. This is done by measuring actual time and space consumption during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Provides practical insights into the algorithm's efficiency under real-world conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** After implementing a sorting algorithm, you might measure the actual time it takes to sort a specific dataset or the amount of memory space it consumes during execution.\n",

    "- **Analysis:** It helps to understand how the algorithm's execution time increases as the input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** If you have a searching algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n), it implies that the time taken to perform the search grows logarithmically with the size of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Analysis:** It helps to understand how the algorithm's memory requirements increase as the input size grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** A sorting algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) indicates that the additional memory used by the algorithm is directly proportional to the size of the dataset being sorted.\n",

    "### On What?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Case: \n",
    "- **Definition:** Best case analysis involves calculating the performance of an algorithm for the best possible input of a given size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis:** It helps to understand the algorithm's best possible runtime and memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** For a sorting algorithm, the best case would be when the input dataset is already sorted. In this case, the algorithm would have to perform the minimum number of comparisons and swaps, resulting in the best possible runtime and memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worst Case:\n",
    "- **Definition:** Worst case analysis involves calculating the performance of an algorithm for the worst possible input of a given size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis:** It helps to understand the algorithm's worst possible runtime and memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**  For a sorting algorithm, the worst case would be when the input dataset is sorted in reverse order. In this case, the algorithm would have to perform the maximum number of comparisons and swaps, resulting in the worst possible runtime and memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average Case:\n",
    "- **Definition:** Average case analysis involves calculating the performance of an algorithm for an average input of a given size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis:** It helps to understand the algorithm's average runtime and memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:** For a sorting algorithm, the average case would be when the input dataset is randomly ordered. In this case, the algorithm would have to perform an average number of comparisons and swaps, resulting in the average runtime and memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Worst Case always gives the efficient analysis of an algorithm.  \n",
